# Beehive-Solitaire
A different version of solitaire which has been coded in Java using different techniques which include OOP (Object Oriented Programming), graphics and more!
This was my final project for grade 12 computer science class. I had to create a game of solitaire from scratch, making everything by scratch including the cards, the deck, and all the functions. I had to utilize OOP immensely to do this since it made everything that much easier. I had to keep track of the deck, how much cards are on the table, how much to deal out, and code each card with it's unique ID so it could be added or taken out whenever needed.
